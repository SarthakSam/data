<!-- hello everyone -->

<p>orem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the <i>printing and typesetting</i><strong>hello</strong> <em>industry.<em>buffallo</em> Lorem</em> Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>

<p> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop 

publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
